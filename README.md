Data Science Internship Projects at CodeSoft
As part of my Data Science internship at CodeSoft, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of real-world projects, each designed to strengthen my analytical and machine learning skills. Below are the key projects I completed:

Titanic Survival Prediction: Developed a predictive model to determine the survival likelihood of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The project involved extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Iris Species Classification: Implemented a classification model to accurately identify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. Leveraged techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and deep learning.

Movie Success Prediction: Built a model to predict the success of movies based on various features like budget, genre, and cast. The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model tuning using ensemble methods.

Credit Card Fraud Detection: Developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection techniques and supervised learning methods. This project focused on handling imbalanced data, feature selection, and optimizing model performance.

Sales Prediction: Created a predictive model to forecast sales for a retail store. The project involved time series analysis, trend identification, and model development using ARIMA and machine learning algorithms.
