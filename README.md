Project : Titanic Survival Prediction

Over view :

This project involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset includes features such as age, sex, passenger class, and number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard. 
The project aims to explore the impact of these features on survival rates and to build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of survival for new passengers.
Key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation. Visualizations and insights are provided to understand the survival patterns among different passenger groups.
